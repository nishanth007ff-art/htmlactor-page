    The Vijayanagara Empire (c. 1336–1646) was a powerful South Indian Hindu empire, founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, known for its immense wealth, sophisticated administration, and flourishing arts, especially architecture (like Hampi), with its capital city, Vijayanagara, becoming a major urban center before its destruction after the Battle of Talikota in 1565. It dominated southern India, supported diverse cultures and religions, and thrived on trade, leaving a lasting legacy in its magnificent ruins.
